# easySSM
At first this is just a simple example of the Spring/SpingMVC/MyBatis project,
after the SSM structure finished there might be plus with BootStrap+AngularJS+Shiro and something else polular,
this is a totally open mind project you can put whatever you think is cool inside,
the only rule is do not modify the exsited files and just add your own feature and note it.

By the initial commit,there is a SSM structure and a Mybatis auto-generator(directory->generator),the building SQL(directory->sql).
This project developed with IntelliJ IDEA 14,JDK1.7,TOMCAT 7,not recommended develop with eclipse
